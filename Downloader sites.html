<article id="sites" class="clear">
	<div class="articleBody">
                
                <p>These sites are tried to rerieve audio clips:</p>
<h2>Beolingus</h2>
<p><a href="http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/doc/about.en.html">Beolingus</a> is an online
dictionary provided by the
<a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/en/"><span class="qtbase tu">TU</span> Chemnitz</a>.</p>
<p>The site provides German↔English, German↔Portuguese and German↔Spanish
dictionaries and pronuctiations in English, German and Spanish.</p>
<h2><span id='gtts'>Google TTS</span></h2>
<p>Goole TTS is the text-to-speech part of
<a href="http://translate.google.com/#auto/en/">Google Translate</a>.  It is the
only text-to-speech services among the downloaders. The advantage is
that this will almost always get you an audio version of the text
enterend – when Google TTS works for your language at all – and can be
used to get an audio version of whole sentences, not just single
words.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that that this will almost always get you an audio
version of the text enterend, even when it is misspelled.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that it is a robot voice. It may hide
idiosyncrasies of the phrase or word.</p>
<h2><span id="jpod">Japanesepod</span></h2>
<p>Downloads audio provided by
<a href="http://www.japanesepod101.com/">JapanesePod101</a>.  This is the same
data source as
<a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1C">Jim Breen's WWWJDIC</a>
uses for its Japanese audio. WWWJDIC
is the dictionary called “edict” by the
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684">Japanese Support add-on</a>.</p>
<p>This was the main motivation for writing this add-on. By providing a
way to download these pronunciations this add-on is a replacement for
the Anki-1 plugins “Audio Download” and “Audio Download (Extension)”,
as mentioned on
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/ankisrs/breen/ankisrs/UHGEpSkWf9k/3bFJ71AimCEJ">Google Groups</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="blacklist">Blacklist</span></h3>
<p>The download mechanism at Japanesepod can’t really say
<a href="nopagehere.html">“no”</a> in the usual way. Instead it sends you an
audio clip that tells you “The audio for this clip is currently not
available. It will be recorded and uploaded shortly. Thank you for
your patience.”. While that is a nice gesture, after hearing that
message two or three times the voice starts sounding a bit like <span
class="qtbase sonya">Sonya</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/blacklist.png"
alt="Review dialog with a skull-and-bones button">
<figcaption>Use the skull-and-bones button to blacklist a file.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To deal with this phenomenon, this add-on provides another button in
the download review dialog, called “blacklist”. Click this for each
file where you get the “... currently not
available...” spiel. The add-on will then store a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hash</a> for
this file. When the same file is seen again, it is quietly dropped and
you may receive a “Nothing downloaded” message.</p>
<h2>Leo</h2>
<p>These audio files come from
<a href="http://www.leo.org/index_en.html">LEO GmbH</a>, originaly founded by the
<a href="http://www.in.tum.de/en.html">Department of Informatics</a> of the
<a href="http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/"><span class="qtbase tu">TU</span> München</a>.
They offer “five (<a href="http://www.leo.org/index_en.html">sic</a>)
dictionaries”, German↔Chinese, German↔English, German↔French,
German↔Italian, German↔Russian and German↔Spanish. Of these seven
languages, they have audio files for Chinese, English, French, German
and Spanish. I could not find words for Italian and Russian, but they
may be added at some point.</p>
<h3>Chinese</h3>
<p>The Chinese pronunciations use a version of pinyin with tone
numbers. Learners of Chinese should install the
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3448800906">Chinese support</a>
add-on. That add-on brings along the <a href="http://cjklib.org/">cjklib</a>,
which is then used to transforms pinyin with accents into the right
form with numbers.</p>
<h2>Macmillan</h2>
<p>This downloader gets  pronunciations from the
<a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/">Macmillan Dictionary</a> site.</p>
<p>Apart from the pronunciation, for some words that name sounds or
noises, the dictionary offers “sound effects”, that are also
downloaded. Try downloading
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">house</a>” or “thunder”. The
sound effects should be marked in the bubble help text in the review.</p>
<p>Macmillan Dictionary is available in a British English and an American
Engilsh version. To counterbalance the American English of
Merriam-Webster, the standard install of the add-on uses the British
version. See <a href="#sitesonoff">below</a> how to turn on the American English
version instead.</p>
<h2>Merriam-Webster</h2>
<p>American English pronunciations from the
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/index.htm">Merriam-Webster</a>
online dictionary.</p>
<h2>Wiktionary</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a> is the dictionary branch of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The add-on tries to download words for every language. Where you get
any results is hard to say.</p>
<p>As these sound files are all uploaded by users, it is possible (even
if unlikely) that some files do not contain what the should. They
<em>might</em> even contain obsecnities. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_disclaimer">Content disclaimer</a>
from Wikipedia applies. If you encounter an incorrect file, the best
way to proceed is to clean up the wiktionary page in
question.</p>
<p>The different language versions of Wiktionary add audio clips in
different ways to their word pages. When the add-on did not download a
pronunciation that is present on a specifc Wiktionary page, please
<a href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/issues?state=open">report this</a>. I
will then try to find a way to extract that word, so that it should be
downloaded with an updated version of the add-on.</p>
<h2><span id="sitesonoff">Using different sites</span></h2>
<p>The add-on loads the different downloaders through the list
“<code>downloaders</code>” in the file “<a
href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/blob/master/downloadaudio/downloaders/__init__.py">
<code>downloadaudio/downloaders/__init__.py</code></a>”. To get to the file, use
the “Tools/Add-ons/Open Add-ons Folder...”  menu item, then open the
folder “<code>downloadaudio</code>” and in there “<code>downloaders</code>”.</p>
<p>The downloaders are tried in the order they appear there. To change
this order or to switch on or off downloaders, rearrange the list
entries, or add or remove “<code>#</code>” characters before the name. Lines
starting with a “<code>#</code>” are comments in Python. Those lines are not
used, nothing will be downloaded from these sites.</p>
<p>For example, to change the Macmillan downloads from British English to
American English, add a “<code>#</code>” character to the line
“<code>MacmillanBritishDownloader(),</code>” and remove it from the line “<code>#
MacmillanAmericanDownloader(),</code>”. (Do not remove the comma or
parantheses. Do not make other changes unless you know what you are
doing.)</p>
<p>After you have made changes to the file and saved it, you need to
restart Anki for the changes to take effect.</p>
