                <p>This add-on adds three menu items,</p>
<ul>
<li>“Edit/Media/Note audio”</li>
<li>“Edit/Media/Side audio” and</li>
<li>“Edit/Media/Manual audio”,</li>
</ul>
<p>All three try to download audio in slightly different manners from a
number of sources. It also adds a button to the edit card screens to
download from there.
<span class="clear" /></p>
<h2>First start – Language</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/Set%20language.png" alt="A Dialog window. Text: Set
download language code Set the code of the language you are
learning. (zh for Chinese, en for English ...) Below a text input line
with text ja.">
<figcaption>Set the code of the language you are learning on
startup.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <span class="qtbase nolangcode">first time</span> you <span
class="qtbase profload">start</span> Anki after downloading the
add-on, a dialog will appear asking for a language code. Here you
should select the language you are learning, not your native language.</p>
<blockquote class="nb">When setting the language, use language
codes. Do <em>not</em> use country domain names. For example, use
<code>zh</code> for Chinese, <em>not</em>
<code>cn</code>.</blockquote>

<p>A list of audio codes can – unsprprisingly – be found at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h2>Setup – Fields</h2>
<p>This add-on adds the pronunciation to a field named “Audio”. You will
probably have to <a href="Add%20audio%20field.html">add this field</a> to your notes.
This has to be done for each note type you use.</p>
<p>More sophisticated uses are also possible. Interested users can look
at the <a href="Detailed%20audio%20field%20rules.html">detailed rules</a> on field
selection for hints on how to use more then one pronunciation per
note.</p>
<h2>Setup – Cards</h2>
<p>To use the downloaded data, you have to
<a href="Add%20audio%20to%20cards.html">add the field</a> to a card.</p>
<p>Here, too, more sophisticated uses are described on an
<a href="More%20audio%20cards.html">extra page</a>.</p>
<h2>Downloading</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/manual_audio.png" alt="Anki with a card shown and the
mouse pointing to the menu item
Edit/Media/Manual audio.">
<figcaption>Use these menus when reviewing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When reviewing, select one of the three “Edit/Media/Note audio”,
“Edit/Media/Side audio” and “Edit/Media/Manual audio” menu items to
download.</p>
<p>When editing or adding cards, click the <span class="qtbase
sendicons">megaphone</span> button above the field edit list to do a
manual download.</p>
<h3>Side audio</h3>
<p>Side audio loads audio that will appear on the currently visible
side. During the <a href="#review">review</a>, it will hide the text it used to
get the sounds. Use this while learning from your native language to
the foreign language, or when trying to recoginize spoken words.</p>
<h3>Note audio</h3>
<p>Note audio fetches sounds for all audio fields of the current note.
During the <a href="#review">review</a>, the texts used to
retrieve the sounds are shown.</p>
<h3>Manual audio</h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/update_annex.png" alt="Anki Download audio dialog
window. Text: Requestst send to the download sites. Front. Edit text:
to annex. The to is marked..">
<figcaption>Edit the request before it is send.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Manual audio mode opens a dialog showing all fields where files can be
downloaded. The texts, as well as the language to use, can be changed
before the request is send.</p>
<p><span  class="clear" />
<figure>
<img src="images/update_kanji_kana.png" alt="Anki Download audio dialog
window. Text: Requestst send to the download sites. Reading. Edit texts:
夫 おっと, Text: Expression. Edit text 夫.">
<figcaption>Edit Japanese text.</figcaption>
</figure>
When learning Japanese or Chinese, when there is a “Reading” field,
the text used as request and shown in the dialog is split into the
base text and the reading.</p>
<p>For Chinese the base text is usually just hanzi, the reading
pinyin. For Japanese, the screen text calls the base text “kanji” for
simplicity, but it often contains kana as well.</p>
<p>For decks like that shown in in the first example
you should use the “Note audio” mode: most dictionaries have
pronunciations for verbs without “to” and for nouns without
article. Delete these in the note audio dialog. For example download for
“annex”, not for “to annex”.</p>
<p>Along with the edit field or fields for the request text, the edit
dialog also as a field to set the  language code. This can be used to
download in a language different from that set for the current deck,
even when the <a href="#tags">tag</a> is not set for the current note.</p>
<h2><span id="review">Review</span></h2>
<p>When the add-on could not find anything to download, a brief
notification appears.</p>
<figure><img src="images/devise.png"
alt="The review dialog. The buttons are described in the main text">
<figcaption>Decide what to do whith each file.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After a successful download, a dialog appears. It lists the
retrieved audio clips, one per row.  The icon for each shows the
source, Hovering over the icon or the word shows some information
about the file.</p>
<p>Each row has a number of buttons, one or two play buttons and three or
four radio buttons.</p>
<p>The left (or only) play button plays the newly retrieved file. If
there is a second play button, the field where the new audio clip will
be added is not empty. Clicking this button plays the old field
content.</p>
<p>To the right, there are three or four radio buttons. Select one for
each line. They determine what happens to the downloaded file.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>add</em> check mark. When this button is down the audio clip will
  be added to the card. This is the normal thing to select for a good
  download, but when many files were downloaded, you may want to
  add only a few of them.</li>
<li>The <em>keep</em> <span class="qtbase sendicons">question mark</span>
  icon. When this button is down, the add-on will neither add the file
  to the card nor delete it but keep it in the media collection
  folder. This means the file will show up as an unused medium and may
  be deleted during an unused media check.</li>
<li>The <em>delete</em> cross mark button. When this button is down the audio
  clip will be deleted. This is the normal thing to do with a file you
  don’t like.</li>
<li>There may be a <em>blacklist</em> skull-and-bones button. When this is
  down, the same file will be dropped in the future. See
  <a href="Downloader%20sites.html#blacklist">blacklist</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<h3>Changing languages</h3>
<p>After the start, the language code can be
<a href="Setting%20deck%20options.html">changed in the deck options</a>,
under the general tab. This can be done separately for each
options group. Like this, it is possible to use different download
languages with different decks. See also the
<a href="http://ankisrs.net/docs/dev/manual.html#deckoptions">Anki manual</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="tags">Using tags</span></h3>
<p>When a note has a tag in the form “<code>lang_&lt;NN&gt;</code>” (e.g. “<code>lang_en</code>” for
English, “<code>lang_zh</code>” Chinese), this language code (that is “<code>en</code>” or
 “<code>zh</code>”) is used for the download.</p>
<h3>Supported languages</h3>
<p>The languages this add-on supports depends on the languages of the
dictionaries used.</p>
<p>At the moment, you can get pronunciations for</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese (Mandarin, i think) (<code>zh</code>)  from <a href="http://leo.org">LEO.org</a>,</li>
<li>English (<code>en</code>) from <a href="http://beolingus.org">BeoLingus</a>,
  <a href="http://leo.org">LEO.org</a>,
  <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/">Macmillan Dictionary</a> and
  <a href="http://merriam-webster.com">Merriam-Webster</a></li>
<li>French (<code>fr</code>) from <a href="http://leo.org">LEO.org</a></li>
<li>German (<code>de</code>) from <a href="http://beolingus.org">BeoLingus</a>,
  <a href="http://www.duden.de">Duden</a> and <a href="http://leo.org">LEO.org</a></li>
<li>Japanese (<code>ja</code>) fram <a href="japanesepod101.com">JapanesePod</a></li>
<li>Spanish (<code>es</code>) from <a href="http://beolingus.org">BeoLingus</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is the potential for</p>
<ul>
<li>Italian  (<code>it</code>) and</li>
<li>Russian  (<code>ru</code>),</li>
</ul>
<p>but i think <a href="http://leo.org">LEO</a> is only offering a text dictionary
for those two languages, not their own audio files.</p>
<p>Google translate list over 60 languages for text translations. It
seems unlikely that they offer text-to-speech services for more. The
simplest way to see if GoogleTTS works for your target language is to
send a request or two and see (hear) if you get a useful reply.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a> is asked with any language
code. The add-on may or may not find anything useful.</p>
<p>More information in the <a href="Downloader%20sites.html">list of sites</a> used.</p>
<h2>Private use</h2>
<p>These audio files can be freely downloaded without registering or
agreeing to a license, but they keep the copyright of those providing
them. While i see no problem with using them privately, especially for
educational purposes, re-publishing, for example by uploading a shared
deck to AnkiWeb, is most likely prohibited by those rights.</p>
<p>As exceptions is wiktionary. Those files are usually available under
the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike
License</a>. See the
<a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_use">Wikimedia Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="nb">
Do not publish decks with audio clips downloaded with this add-on
without ensuring you have the rights to do so.
</blockquote>

<h2>No bulk download</h2>
<p>This add-on does not do bulk downloads. That is, there is no way to
let it go through the whole collection and download something for
every card. There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>It appears that the Google TTS service throttles the number of reply
  it delivers when they requests are send too quickly. (At least the
  <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/301952613">AwesomTTS add-on</a> has
  code to work around this problem, needed or not.)</li>
<li>As there may be many files downloaded for each word, i think  the
  review of the downloaded material should not be skipped.</li>
<li>This is especially true for Japanesepod, where you may want to
  <a href="Downloader%20sites.html#blacklist">blacklist</a> some downloads.</li>
<li>Contemplating the downloaded data when you get it note by note is
  also potentially useful in remembering the words.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>Bugs and other issues can be reported at the
<a href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/issues?state=open">github repository</a>
(pull requests with patches welcome) or possibly at a
<a href="http://no.such-domain.nope/NN">Google Groups thread</a> i may start soon.</p>
<h3>Audio processing</h3>
<p>The standard installation saves the files as they are received, which
works well enough. Nothing more is needed.</p>
<p>But the add-on contains code to do some simple audio processing,
normalising the files and changing the output format. This code is not
used by default, as it requires two extra Python packages,
<a href="http://pydub.com/">PyDub</a> and
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysox/0.3.6.alpha">pysox</a>. Pysox has
still alpha status, and installing it isn’t always easy, either.
Hackers that do manage that may then want to take a look at the
content of the
“<a href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/tree/master/downloadaudio/processors"><code>downloadaudio/processors</code></a>”
directory.</p>
<h3>More ideas</h3>
<p>Things that might be added in the future (but don’t hold your breath):</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch off the menu items when not reviewing.</li>
<li>Automatically edit the information before the request is sent. I use
  what i call “electric” cards for Japanese verbs, where the different
  forms are formed automatically. That means that the whole word
  doesn’t actually appear in the note. While it is no big problem to
  complete the word in the “Manual audio” dialog, the add-on could
  automatically add the 「る」 for 一段動詞.  This will most likely
  not by implemented any time soon.</li>
<li>More talking dictionaries. Links welcome. Mention them in the
  dedicated
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ankisrs-users/yyixoEYy8tc">Google Groups thread</a>. Python
  files welcome. Take a look at
  <a href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/tree/master/downloadaudio/downloaders"><code>downloadaudio/downloaders</code></a>,
  write a new class derived from <code>AudioDownloader</code> and send me a pull
  request. Or just the <code>.py</code>-file.</li>
</ul>
