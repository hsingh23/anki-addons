                <p>Automatically download audio from Google TTS and Japanesepod.</p>
<p>This add-on adds three menu items, “Note audio”, “Side audio” and
“Manual audio”, that all try to download audio in slightly different
manners.</p>
<h2>Please be patient</h2>
<p>While the add-on is pretty much finished, this manual page is
not. Please be patient.</p>
<h2>Fields</h2>
<p>The download mechanism looks for audio fields to store the information
in, according to two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>When there is a field called “<span class="qtbase
  ignorecase">Expression</span>”, “<span class="qtbase
  ignorecase">Front</span>”, or “<span class="qtbase
  ignorecase">Back</span>”, the add-on looks for a field called “<span
  class="qtbase ignorecase">Audio</span>” or “<span class="qtbase
  ignorecase">Sound</span>”.</li>
<li>For other fields, the add-on looks for a second field with the same
  name with “Audio” or “Sound” added. Like this, one note can store
  different audio files for different fields. For example, a geography
  deck can have fields “Country” and “Capital”. When that note
  also has fields “Country Audio” and “Capital Audio”, the add-on can
  download pronunciation for these two fields separately.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Japanesepod</h3>
<p>Downloading Japanese pronunciations from Japanesepod works a little
bit different. The field must be set up in the way used by the
Japanese support addon, that is, there should be a “<span class="qtbase
  ignorecase">Reading</span>” field and an “Audio” or “Sound”
field. The reading field must contain both the kanji and kana for
the requested word, with the reading for the kanji in square
brackets. For example as 「仮定[かてい]」, which will be automatically
split into 「仮定」 and 「かてい」.</p>
<p>Alternative names for “Reading” are “Kana”, 「かな」and 「仮名」.</p>
<p>Also, when “Audio” is just a substring, that substring is replaced
with “Reading”, not removed. For example, when you have a field
“Japanese Audio”, you need another field “Japanese Reading”.</p>
<h2>Manual, note, side</h2>
<p>Two of the three download modes, note and side mode, immediately
download the audio when triggered. The note mode checks all the fields
of the card and downloads for suitable fields. The side mode only
downloads files for the visible side of the current card.</p>
<h2>Private use</h2>
<p>These audio files can be freely downloaded without registering or
agreeing to a license, but they keep the copyright of those providing
them. While i see no problem with using them privately, re-publishing,
for example by uploading a shared deck to AnkiWeb, is most likely
prohibited by those rights.</p>
<h2>Ideas for improvements</h2>
<p>While this add-on works as it is, a few things would be nice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically edit the information before the request is sent. I use
   what i call “electric” cards for Japanese verbs, where the
   different forms are formed automatically. That means that the whole
   word doesn’t actually appear on the card. While it is no big
   problem to complete the word in the “Manual audio” dialog, the
   add-on could automatically add the 「る」 for 一段動詞.</li>
</ul>
